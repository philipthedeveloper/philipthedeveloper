<!--- ### Hi there! 👋

I'm a software developer with experience in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**. I'm also exploring **AI** and **machine learning** to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with new technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy **drawing** as a creative outlet.

Feel free to check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/philipthedeveloper).

Let’s connect and build something awesome together. 😊 --->
